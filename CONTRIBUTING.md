## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

If you think that you have found a security vulnerability, please email dbhurley@me.com with as much detail as possible. The core team will review the vulnerability and if found applicable, will create the patch in a private repository. The vulnerability will be disclosed once the patch has been included into a release. 

## Contributing Code

Development is open and available to any member of the Saelos community. All fixes and improvements are done through pull requests to the code. This code is open source and publicly available. 

### Developer Documentation

API documentation is available at [https://api.saelos.org/](https://api.saelos.org/).  To make additions or corrections to the documentation, submit Issues or Pull Requests against [https://github.com/saelos/documentation](https://github.com/saelos/documentation).

### Core Feature Development Procedures

Pull Requests with additional features should be created with the Saelos Core goals in consideration. Any features that are created for core that don’t follow the overall goals may not be included. 

In addition to following the general direction of the development goals, the pull request code must be well-formed following coding standards and guidelines. If you wish to target a specific release version number for the feature, it's best to make the pull request early so any feedback from the core team can be implemented and adequate testing can be performed. 

Features that are determined not to fit within the direction of the Saelos Core goals are more than welcome to be created as plugins instead.
